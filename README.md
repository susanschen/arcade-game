## Nanodegree Project Description

This game is a project for the Front-End Nanodegree course on Udacity. The purpose of this project is to expand a student's knowledge of HTML5 canvas and object-oriented programming with javascript.

Udacity provided the game engine and image assets on [Github](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game). Upon opening the provided index.html, a student is faced with a blank screen. As a student, I have to write code to complete the game from setting up the enemies' and player's locations,  moving the player based on a user's keys input, moving the enemies across the screen at random speed and interval, testing for canvas boundary, testing for the player's collision with an enemy, and resetting the game once the player reaches the water.
