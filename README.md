# Frogger Arcade Game.
This game is based on a classic arcade game from 1981, where the goal is to get the frog across the road without getting run over by obstacles.

In this version, you have to get the boy across the road to the river without getting run over by bugs. The game resets if a bug hits the boy.

Move the player by using the arrow keys for "up", "down", "left", and "right".

## Project Description
This game is built as a project for the Front-End Nanodegree course on Udacity. Udacity provided the game engine and image assets on [Github](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

### Basic Project Requirements
Upon opening the provided index.html, a student is faced with a blank screen. As a student, I have to write code to get the game started and to complete the game from setting up the enemies' and player's locations,  moving the player based on a user's keys input, moving the enemies across the screen at random speed and interval, testing for canvas boundary, testing for the player's collision with an enemy, and resetting the game once the player reaches the water.

### Extra Functionality
Students are given images assets to build extra features into the game. I have chosen to add rocks as obstacles to limit the player's movement.
